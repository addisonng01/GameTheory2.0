Website for the College of Saint Scholastica's Economics courses. The project aims to create game simulations for various activities that are used in Economics courses in order to teach concepts.

The application is made to use CRUD by connecting an SQL database in order to offer login/sign-on functionality. 
Additionally, the database is used for administrators to view statistics and comments left by students after completing games in order to gain insight on what the students may have learned.

The application is made using Javascript, SQL, PHP, and HTML/CSS to create the web pages and functionality.
